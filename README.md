![PetBNB]

# Introduction
([visit the LIVE site](https://pet-bnb.cyclic.app)

PetBNB is a Simple Social Media application built using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Mongoose, and Bootstrap. It utilizes the MVC Architecture, MongoDB and MongoAtlas NoSQL database - with Cloudinary image hosting, and implements "local authorization" for user sign-up and login.

PetBNB was built on the idea of providing the users with the ability of listing their location as host to pets where owners may wish to leave their pets with an individual for a selected period. Similarly, the users can also look up these locations and get into contact with their potential host from a list of hosts by creating a booking for their pet.

## Objectives

This application was built to strengthen my understanding of the various libraries and elements used within while also seeking to solve and internal problem within the the pet owners and lovers community. Feel free to give it a ::star:: and fork it to make it your own!

Additionally, I created the project for a period of over 100 hours as a fullstack application with the listed technologies.
